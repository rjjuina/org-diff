#+TITLE: org-diff Test Example

* Testing org-diff functionality

Here's an example diff block to test with:

#+begin_diff
Hello world
Hello world
Hi world
Hello world!
Good morning world
#+end_diff

** Instructions for testing:

1. Load the org-diff.el file in Emacs: ~M-x load-file~ and select org-diff.el
2. Open this test-example.org file
3. Place cursor anywhere within the diff block above
4. Run ~M-x org-diff-check~ to analyze differences
5. You should see:
   - Line 1: "Hello world" (normal - reference line)
   - Line 2: "Hello world" (dimmed - identical to line 1)
   - Line 3: "Hi world" ("Hi" should be highlighted/bold)
   - Line 4: "Hello world!" ("!" should be highlighted/bold)
   - Line 5: "Good morning world" ("Good morning" should be highlighted/bold)
6. Run ~M-x org-diff-clear~ to remove all highlighting

** Template expansion test:

Type ~<diff~ followed by TAB to expand into a new diff block.

#+begin_diff

#+end_diff
